# Gesture_Keyboard_IOT
This Project is based on Python Library of SVM algorithm which is a ML kit function we used a Arduino Nano or NodeMCU ESP 8266 Board for our development.


What is pyGARL?
pyGARL stands for Python Gesture Analysis and Recognition Library and, as you may expect, it's used to build gesture recognition systems. I decided to build it because, after the success of my previous project ( the Gesture Keyboard ), I felt that a general purpose gesture recognition library would have been useful for a lot of people.

Installation
The installation is pretty straightforward:

pip install pygarl

NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: the package requires scikit-learn and scipy to work. The easy way to install them is by using Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/download/ ).
